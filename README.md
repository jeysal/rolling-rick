## Build game

The game is built with TypeScript and Phaser. To build the game, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

or run in watch mode with:

```
npm run dev
```

The source files are under the `src/game` directory. The game JavaScript files are built in the `game` directory (like `game.js`).
